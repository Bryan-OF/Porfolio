                  To convey our website idea for Lekker Bakkie, a coffee
                  delivery service, I created this prototype website with the
                  help of my group. Our concept for Lekker Bakkie is a coffee
                  delivery service that delivers coffee around the city daily
                  using cargo bikes. It is designed to assist people who are
                  running late for work or cannot visit a coffee shop. Customers
                  can order their drinks in advance and pick them up without
                  having to wait for their preparation.

                <h3>Design Challenge</h3>
                <div class="white-space-10"></div>
                <p>
                  In a bustling city like Amsterdam, many professionals face a
                  common problem: they are often pressed for time and cannot
                  afford to wait in long lines for their daily coffee. Whether
                  they are running late for work or trying to maximize their
                  short breaks, the inconvenience of obtaining a quality cup of
                  coffee can disrupt their routines and reduce productivity. The
                  challenge is to create a service that delivers high-quality
                  coffee quickly and conveniently to these busy individuals,
                  without them having to visit a coffee shop.

                <div class="white-space-10"></div>
                <p>
                  Our design process began with thorough market research and
                  user analysis to understand the pain points of our target
                  audience. <br />
                  We identified key issues such as time constraints, the need
                  for quality coffee, and the inconvenience of traditional
                  coffee shop visits.

                <p>
                  <b>4. Prototyping:</b> Developed a prototype for a
                  user-friendly app that allows customers to order coffee in
                  advance and select a delivery location.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>5. Testing:</b> Tested the prototype with a small group of
                  users, gathering feedback to refine the service and improve
                  the user experience.
