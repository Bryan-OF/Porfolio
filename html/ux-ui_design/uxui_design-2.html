                  In the "Responsive Multi-Device Design" project, I designed an 
                  streaming website/app concept called Watch Party. The idea for 
                  this app is that users can watch videos and series with friends 
                  and family through one app. The app would work across multiple 
                  platforms, such as smartphones and smart TVs, allowing users to 
                  watch at their convenience at the same time without dalay. It 
                  would also allow you to watch content together with friends and 
                  family members that are not living in the same household. This 
                  project focused on reseacrhing and design application that would 
                  give users.

                <h3>Project objective</h3>
                <div class="white-space-10"></div>
                <p>
                  The goal was to provide an innovative solution for collaborative 
                  video viewing that focused on ease of use and accessibility. This 
                  project was perfect for me because it challenged both my design 
                  and development skills and gave me the opportunity to create a 
                  product that addresses a real need.

                <h3>User scenario</h3>
                <div class="white-space-10"></div>
                <p>
                  The primary user for this application would be a student in their 
                  twenties who watches a lot of TV series/movies together. Since 
                  everyone has a different schedule, they don't have time to watch 
                  together. With Watch Party, they could watch simultaneously on 
                  different devices, such as smartphones and smart TVs, and 
                  communicate via video and text chat, to watch together. This solves 
                  the problem of physical distance and different schedules and also 
                  synchronises content to play at the same time.

                <h3>Product requirements</h3>
                <div class="white-space-10"></div>
                <p>
                  Watch Party needs the following requirements to work perfectly:
                </p>

                <div class="white-space-10"></div>

                <P><b>Must have</b></P>

                <p>
                  • A calling system for video and audio calls.
                </p>

                <p>
                  • A notification system to inform users when a Watch Party starts.
                </p>

                <p>
                  • A messaging system for text chat.
                </p>

                <p>
                  • A security system to protect accounts.
                </p>

                <p>
                  • A calendar system to schedule Watch Parties.
                </p>

                <p>
                  • A search function to find videos and series on various streaming platforms.
                </p>

                <div class="white-space-10"></div>

                <P><b>Nice to have</b></P>

                <p>
                  • Host control over Watch Party access.
                </p>

                <p>
                  • A voting poll system to decide which series or film to watch.
                </p>

                <p>
                  • A To-Watch calendar to save future viewing options.
                </p>
    
                <div class="white-space-30"></div>

                <h3>Design process</h3>
                <div class="white-space-10"></div>
                <p>
                  The design phase began by researching existing products such as Discord, 
                  Teleparty and YouTube to see which would be best to integrate the best 
                  features into the app. Inspiration was drawn from various streaming 
                  websites and the final design combined elements of Netflix, Discord and 
                  Outlook. Using wireflows and prototypes, the app was iteratively improved. 
                  This would also give users a sense of familiarity and it would also make 
                  the app easier to control.
                </p>

                <div class="white-space-30"></div>

                <h3>The End result</h3>
                <div class="white-space-10"></div>
                <p>
                  The end result was a user-friendly and versatile application that allowed 
                  videos to be viewed collectively. The combination of different designs 
                  ensured easy navigation and an intuitive user experience. Although 
                  improvements can still be made, the app provides a solid foundation 
                  for further development and refinement. 
                </p>

                <p>
                  This project not only improved my design skills, but also my ability to 
                  design and implement user-centric solutions.
                </p>
